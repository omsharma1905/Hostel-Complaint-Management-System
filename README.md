![Complaint Management System](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100947528/225574700-3abd3df2-93f1-4420-b324-343ac293dbb4.png)
This is a **Hostel Complaint Management System** built to streamline the process of complaint registration and management for my college's hostel services. The app aims to provide a faster and more efficient way to handle complaints, improving communication between students and hostel administration.


This is one of my very first Flutter applications, featuring **Google OAuth authentication** using Firebase, along with **Firebase** as the backend for real-time complaint registration. The app uses a **GridView** to display various complaint categories for easy selection and submission.

> **Note**: The `FirebaseOption` file is not included in this repository. Please contact me if you need more details about the project setup.

## Features
- **Google OAuth Authentication**: Secure login for users using their Google accounts via Firebase.
- **Real-time Complaint Registration**: Submit and manage complaints instantly with Firebase as the backend.
- **GridView UI**: Provides an intuitive and user-friendly way to navigate through different complaint categories.
- **Firebase Integration**: Handles user authentication, complaint submission, and real-time updates.

## Technologies Used
- **Flutter**: Cross-platform mobile development.
- **Firebase**: For backend services including real-time database and Google OAuth authentication.
- **GridView**: To display complaint categories in a clean, structured layout.
